ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs are both cryptographic techniques used to verify the validity of data, but they have different applications and work in different ways. In this deep dive, we will explore the differences between ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs in more detail.

Proving Knowledge vs. Proving Existence:
The primary difference between ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs is that they are used for different purposes. ZKSnarks are used to prove knowledge of a particular piece of information, without revealing the information itself. In contrast, Merkle proofs are used to prove the existence of a particular piece of data within a large dataset, without revealing any additional information about the dataset.

- Proof Complexity:
Another important difference between ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs is their proof complexity. ZKSnarks are typically much more complex to generate and verify than Merkle proofs. This is because ZKSnarks are designed to prove a more general statement about the knowledge that is being proven, while Merkle proofs are only concerned with proving the existence of a particular piece of data.

- Verifiability:
Both ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs are designed to be verified by a third party, but they differ in their verifiability. ZKSnarks are designed to be verified by anyone, without requiring any additional information about the proof itself. In contrast, Merkle proofs are usually verified by a specific party, such as a blockchain node, and require additional information about the data structure being proven.

- Privacy:
One of the key advantages of ZKSnarks over Merkle proofs is their ability to maintain privacy. ZKSnarks allow for the proving of knowledge without revealing any additional information about the knowledge itself. This is particularly useful for applications that require privacy, such as anonymous transactions or identity verification. In contrast, Merkle proofs do not provide any privacy guarantees, as they only prove the existence of a particular piece of data within a larger dataset.

- Scalability:
Another important difference between ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs is their scalability. ZKSnarks are generally more difficult to scale than Merkle proofs, as they require significantly more computational resources to generate and verify. Merkle proofs, on the other hand, are relatively simple to generate and verify and can be used to prove the validity of data within large datasets.

In summary, ZKSnarks and Merkle proofs are both cryptographic techniques used to verify the validity of data, but they have different applications and work in different ways. ZKSnarks are used to prove knowledge of a particular piece of information, without revealing the information itself, while Merkle proofs are used to prove the existence of a particular piece of data within a large dataset. ZKSnarks are generally more complex and less scalable than Merkle proofs, but they offer greater privacy guarantees.

EXAMPLES: 

I can prove that I known x such that with a = "2", b = "3", c= "4" and result = "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003d" and x is valid without show x 
or polynomial valid f(x)=a*x*x + b*x - c.

And the mapping is a=Name, b=Age, c=Phone and x=ScretCode. In this case, I can prove that I can have x withou show x for purpose IDENTITY.
